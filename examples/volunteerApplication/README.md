# Motivation
This is a demonstration illustrating the use of a FSM combinator component to display sequence of screens according to a declarative control flow logic and evolving states.

# Running it
- `npm install`
- `npm run wbuild`
- have a look at `src/index.js` and decide whether to reset local storage or not at every page load
  - should be done only when local storage is somehow corrupted (can happen between different 
  windows). By default leave the `localForage.clear()` line commented out
- then open with a local webserver the `index.html` in `$HOMEDIR/examples/volunteerApplication` directory
