# multi repo
- npm registry has pretty bad error management. Put wrong registry url and all I got was cryptic 
error (registry json bla bla)
- also problem with windows and npm, downgraded npm to v5.3 and node to 8.2

# rollup
- some shitty error message (invalid token) solved by removing node_modules and reinstalling
- and having rollup in global (don't know if that played a role though)
