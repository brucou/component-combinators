# Abstract
Section 1 presents reactive systems as an equation linking actions to be undertaken by the system
 to the events received by the system and triggering such actions. A reactive system may be 
 specified as a set of execution traces and a pure reactive function which computes those traces.
Section 2 examines the potential for componentization, by reducing a system into subsystems 
with lower complexity, to lead to higher productivity, maintanability and reliability when 
implementing user interfaces. Componentization can be understood as featuring two key phases : 
breakdown, and recomposition. In the breakdown, parts (components) are identified, which each 
covers a limited set of concerns of the reactive system under implementation. The 
recomposition phase ensures that the whole is indeed reconstructed from the parts, by linking 
otherwise largely indenpendent components into a cohesive whole. We will present 
componentization models from two `purescript` ui libraries as illustrative examples.
   
Section 3 introduces `m`, a generic component combinator which embodies three different patterns 
by which a component is constructed from a component tree. From `m`, a set of combinators representing very frequent operations on components/component trees are derived.

Section 4 shows how to use the proposed componentization framework to concretely produce a 
reactive system. The chosen application is one already implemented with Angular2's 
componentization framework, which will allow for ulterior comparison. We show how we can build 
incrementally a component tree from a specification, and how the proposed component combinators 
help build that tree.


# Componentization
A focus of the software engineering discipline has been, and continues to be,
the development and deployment of techniques for yielding reusable, extensible,
and reliable software [^6]. One proven approach toward obtaining these goals
and others, is to develop software as a collection of independent modules.
This technique is especially effective when the individual modules experience
a low-degree of inter-dependence or coupling [^5]. Modules which are selfcontained
and communicate with others strictly through well-defined interfaces
are not likely to be affected by changes made to the internals of other unrelated
components[^3].

TODO : put in some defense of componentization

# General principles

- App is a component
- App is made out of smaller components addressing a smaller set of separated concerns
- components transforms sources (streams of inputs) into sinks (streams of outputs) and are parameterized through settings
- Components are composed with component combinators
- There are general combinators (applying to any domain)
- There are ad-hoc combinators (specific to the application in question)
- Combinators are all made through a core `m` combinator which is a generic and parameterizable combinator function
  - supports defining contracts which inputs (preconditions) and outputs (postconditions) of the components must satisfy (invariant not specifically supported)
  - supports transforming inputs (sources and settings) of the component
  - supports a notion of component tree with component parent and children components
  - supports several ways to compute the reduced sinks from the parent component sinks and the children components
    - a most generic function which receive all parameter and produces the desired output without making any hypothesis on the inputs
    - a less generic function which receive compute the reduced sinks from the parent component's sinks and the children components' sinks
      - assumes the reduced sinks are not a direct function of the parent component, or the children components (but of their SINKS)
    - a specialized function which processes parent and components' sinks, sink by sink, to produce a given reduced sink
      - assumes that a given reduced sink will not depend directly on a sink of a different nature
        - for instance, reduced DOM sink will not depend on `router` sink but on DOM sink produced by the parent component and the DOM sinks produced by the children components.

# Incremental implementation - Step 0
Case of Mastering Angular2 Components. We suppose :

- domain data model is given (cf. case documentation)
- UI/UX has been defined (cf. case documentation)

## App
From the specifications of the App, we know we will need the following capabilities :

- read from the DOM
- update the DOM
- routing
- querying the domain model
- method invocation on domain aggregate roots/entities
- (probably) managing locally persisted state[^1]
- (probably) managing local, non-persisted state[^1]

This will lead to a cycle application with the following drivers : 

- DOM driver
- document driver
- router driver
- domain model driver
- in-memory store driver

The configuration and parameterization for use of each of those drivers then leads us to inject the following sources and settings :

- whole app
  - names for the driver sinks implementing the application capabilities
    - this information is mandatory for the most important general combinators that are used to compose components
    - while not required by any specific driver, it is good to indicate at top-level of the app, to make it visible in any component composing the application
- router driver
  - ROUTE_SOURCE to indicate the name of the source dealing with routing concerns
  - behaviour source carrying the information of the current route
  - event source associated to route changes

TODO : code for the application shell and the inject settings sources.. with [DummyComponent] as only decomposition  

[^1]: Sidenote : the different types of state
- the persistence notion is seen from a component point of view. 
  - A piece of state is persisted iff : 
    - there exists one component which can access it
    - after that component is destroyed/deactived, it is possible for another component/another execution/instance of the same component to access it
  - A piece of state is local iff :
    - it is always operated on synchronously (that means for instance, read and update operations are synchronous)

- Example of local, non-persisted state : component with `scan`
- Example of locally persisted state : in-memory store
 
# Incremental implementation - Step 1
## MainPanel and SidePanel
Following the user interface, and as a first step of our decomposition, we will seek to write App = f(MainPanel, SidePanel). 

As we can see from the visual specifications, `MainPanel` displays a count of open tasks (summed over all projects), and the list of projects under management. The rest being displayed by `MainPanel` being constant (admin and plugin sections).

TODO : show code replacing [DummyComponent] by [SidePanel, MainPanel] both set to DummyComponent


### What makes a good breakdown
Why this breakdown? `MainPanel` and `SidePanel` are loosely coupled[^4] : 

- data coupling through sources 
- message coupling via the route

[^4]: A. J. Offutt, M. J. Harrold, and P. Kolte. A software metric system for module
      coupling. J. Syst. Softw., 20(3):295–308, 1993.
      
As such implementing `MainPanel` is fairly independent from `SidePanel` implementation :

- the only reason for change of `SidePanel` that would affect `MainPanel` is a change in the 
route associated to the projects
  - the corresponding change can be anticipated by designing `MainPanel` to allow for  
  parameterization of these routes. This would ensure that a change in `SidePanel` does not 
  entail a cange in `MainPanel` implementation, but rather a change in parameterization
- they do not share common events or actions or logic 
  - as such, we have effectively the size of our initial target reactive system by splitting 
  it into two strictly smaller reactive subsystems (events processed by one subsystem are not 
  processed by the other)
  - reducing the size of the reactive system means the complexity of each subsystem is strictly 
  smaller than the original system under implementation (for instance the accidental complexity 
  linked to 'mental-modelling', designing, implementing, testing, maintaining)
- the reduction in complexity resulting for the decomposition is counterbalanced by the increase in 
complexity stemming from the coupling between those two subsystems to ensure the realization of the target system. Because that coupling is low, it is likely that we have overall reduced the complexity of the system, while increasing its maintainability.
  - this is specially likely to be true when the coupling introduced by the componentization 
  framework is predictable (limited number of patterns), standardized, and properly tested 
  
By splitting the application in those two components, we have effectively reduced our implementation problem to the implementation of two reactive systems of lower complexity than the one initially given.

More generally, it is desirable to build complex system by assembling highly cohesive loosely coupled components, where the cost of redesigning each of such adoptable components (or replacing by a better component) can be minimized.

### SidePanel
From the specification of the application, we can derive the specification of the SidePanel :

- DOM
  - init
    - Task summary
    - 3 sections with possibly subsections
  - reactions
    - click on section : navigate to section
    - click on project (subsection) : navigate to project

We define the routes to be navigated to as per specification :

- `/projects/:projectId`
- `/dashboard`
- `/plugins`

To compute the DOM view (in particular the task summary and the projects section), we will need a copy of the remotely stored state concretely persisting the following domain entities: 
 
  - `projects`
  - `user`

We will seek to write SidePanel as :

```javascript
SidePanel = 
  InjectSources({projects, user}, [
    TaskSummary,
    Navigation({}, [
      NavigationSection({ title: 'Main' }, [
        NavigationItem( { project: { title: 'Dashboard', link: 'dashboard' } }, [])
      ]),
      NavigationSection({ title: 'Projects' }, [
        InSlot('navigation-item', [
          ComponentToBeSpecified
        ])
      ]),
      NavigationSection({ title: 'Admin' }, [
        NavigationItem( { project: { title: 'Manage Plugins', link: 'plugins' } }, [])
      ]),
    ])
  ])
```

where :

- `TaskSummary` 
  - from `projects`, computes the number of open tasks
  - from `user`, retrieves the user information
  - with the computed data, display the corresponding view as per specification
- `Navigation` is a component combinator which 
  - accepts children components as an array of components (! not a component tree!, there is no 
  need for a parent here)
  - wraps all `navigation-section` slot content from its children component, following the order in the array of children components, into a `nav` tag
  - passes up unmodified all non-DOM actions (carried by the non-DOM sinks)
  - adds some style specific to its navigation concern
- `NavigationSection` is a component combinator which
  - can (must) be parametrized by a `title` property
  - accepts children components
  - wraps all `navigation-item` slot content from its children component, following the order in the array of children components, into a list
  - passes up unmodified all non-DOM actions from its children component (carried by the non-DOM sinks)
  - adds some style specific to its navigation concern
- `NavigationItem` is a component combinator which
  - can (must) be parametrized by the `title` and `link` properties
  - does not accept children components
  - displays the title, and a click on that title triggers a routing action passed through the router sink
  - emphasizes the current project selection as determined by the current route
- `ComponentToBeSpecified` is a component which
  - from `projects`:
    - get the current list of projects, 
    - computes a title (project name) and a link (`/project/projectId`), 
    - and for each project in that list, accumulates it in the shape of a `NavigationItem` parameterized with the computed title and link 

TODO explain the slot mechanism.
Then SIDENOTE : the slot mechanism : how it works, and what is its essence (use children components' DOM as parameters of the reduced DOM, so allows to break down a DOM instead constant part and variable part - the children, or into different logic (concerns) handled by specific children)

### TaskSummary component
#### How to write a component
Within the choosen architecture (cycle), writing a 'leaf' component, i.e. a component which is 
not derived from other components, but only from `sources` and `settings`, means :

- having clear specifications as per the reactive behaviour to implement
- from the equation `actions = f(state, events)` :
  - identify the relevant events the component reacts to
  - find a way to compute those events from the component's input (`sources` and `settings`)
  - identify the state (behaviour stream) from which one can derive pure functions computing the 
  actions associated to events
  - find a way to compute that state from the available inputs
    - by combining pre-computed/pre-existing state
    - by updating or building that state in response to events (computed from inputs as we 
    mentioned previously), when that applies
    - parameterized by properties from `settings`

#### Example
From its specifications, `TaskSummary` will use as inputs :

- sources.projects
- sources.user

and only emits DOM update actions, hence having only the following sinks :

- DOM

The code is as follows :
```javascript
function tasksSummary(sources, settings) {
  const { user, projects } = sources;
  const state$ = $.combineLatest(user, projects, (user, projects) => ({ user, projects }))
    .shareReplay(1);

  return {
    [DOM_SINK]: state$.map(({ user, projects }) => {
      const openTasksCount = convertFirebaseListToArray(projects)
        .reduce((count, project) => count + project.tasks.filter((task) => !task.done).length, 0);

      return div('.user-area', [
        div('.user-area__l-profile', [
          img({
            attrs: {
              src: user.pictureDataUri
            }
          }, [])
        ]),
        div('.user-area__l-information', [
          p('.user-area__welcome-text', `Hi ${user.name}`),
          openTasksCount
            ? p([`You got `, strong(openTasksCount), ` open tasks.`])
            : p('No open tasks. Hooray!')
        ])
      ])
    })
  }
}
```

### Navigation component combinator
#### How to write a component combinator
- get the specifications right
  - inputs : 
    - parameterization through `settings`
    - dependency on
      - children components, i.e. array of components
      - or tree of components
    - contracts
  - outputs :
    - contracts
    - how to reduce sinks from the component tree into the final computed component 
      - cf. the three most common reducing patterns provided by the `m` component combinator
      - one should try to express the component output as a combination of existing combinators, 
      whose inputs are derived from spec and the passed settings
        - for instance `= m(componentCombinatorSpec, componentCombinatorSettings, 
        childrenComponents | componentTree)`
      - understanding `m` defaults is paramount : often sinks of the same nature are reduced in a 
      way which is generic enough to be able to have a default reducing function
         - by default, in one of its three reducing patterns, `m` reduces any non-DOM children sinks
          by simple merge
           - for instance, if all childrens have a `route` sink, then the final computed 
           component will produce a `route` stream which is the merge of every children `route` sink
         - by default, in one of its three reducing patterns, `m` reduces any DOM children sinks by
           - putting the children DOM into the parent DOM when there is such a parent (case when 
           we deal with a `ComponentTree`)
           - concatenating the children DOM one next to the other, and wrapping the whole into a 
           `div`, when there is no parent DOM sink (`ChildrenComponents` argument type) 
           - for generically parameterizable DOM sink composition, using a slot mechanism copied 
           from web components[^2 slot mechanism].
         
[^2]: explain the three DOM merge casuistry with graphics

#### example

From its specifications, `Navigation` will use the following from its inputs :

- its children components as an array of components with the slot `navigation-section`

and returns a component.

The code is as follows :
```javascript
const NavigationContainer = vLift(
      div('.navigation', [
        nav({ slot: 'navigation-section' }, [])
      ])        
);

function Navigation (navigationSettings, childrenComponents) {
  return m({}, {}, [NavigationContainer, childrenComponents])
}
```

As one can see, the component combinator is easily derived from `m` as the default reducing 
function used by `m` align well with the specifications of the combinator. Notice how the slot 
mechanism allows to select which child component's DOM content will figure where. Notice the 
helper `vLift` which deals with a specific case of components which only emit DOM update actions, 
and make no use of its inputs, i.e. which only emit a constant VNode stream.

### NavigationSection component combinator
From its specifications, `NavigationSection` will use the following from its inputs :

- its children components as an array of components with the slot `navigation-item`
- `title` property passed in settings

and returns a component.

The code is as follows :
```javascript
function NavigationSectionContainer(sources, settings){
    const { title } = settings;
  
    return {
      [DOM_SINK]: $.of(
        div('.navigation-section', { slot: 'navigation-section' }, [
          h2('.navigation-section__title', title),
          ul('.navigation-section__list', { slot: 'navigation-item' }, [])
        ])
      )
    }
}

function Navigation (navigationSectionSettings, childrenComponents) {
  return m({}, {}, [NavigationSectionContainer, childrenComponents])
}
```

Notice how :

- we set the slot at the top level VNode, so it can be picked up by the 
`Navigation` combinator
- we mark where children components' DOM content associated to the `navigation-item` slot will go 

### NavigationItem component
From its specifications, `NavigationItem` will use the following from its inputs :

- `title` and `link` properties passed in settings
- the current

and returns the following sinks :

- router
- DOM

The code is as follows :
```javascript
function NavigationItem(sources, settings) {
  const { url$ } = sources;
  const { project: { title, link } } = settings;
  const linkSanitized = link.replace(/\//i, '_');

  const state$ = url$
    .map(url => url.indexOf(link) > -1)
    .shareReplay(1);

  return {
    [DOM_SINK]: state$
      .map(isLinkActive => {
        const isLinkActiveClass = isLinkActive ? '.navigation-section__link--active' : '';
  
        return a(
          `${isLinkActiveClass}.navigation-item.navigation-section__link.${linkSanitized}`,
          { attrs: { href: link }, slot: 'navigation-item' },
          title
          )
    }),
    // NOTE : we avoid having to isolate by using the link which MUST be unique over the whole
    // application (unicity of a route)
    router: sources.DOM
      .select(`.navigation-section__link.${linkSanitized}`)
      .events('click')
      .do(preventDefault)
      .map(always('/' + link + '/'))
  }
}
```

#### Dealing with list of items
TODO : explain `ComponentToBeSpecified` ends up like

```javascript
ComponentToBeSpecified = 
        InSlot('navigation-item', [
          InjectSources({ projectNavigationItems$: getProjectNavigationItems$ }, [
            ForEach({ from: 'projectNavigationItems$', as: 'projectList' }, [
              ListOf({ list: 'projectList', as: 'project' }, [
                EmptyComponent,
                NavigationItem
              ])
            ])
          ])
        ])
```

- the `InSlot` is important to be picked up and inserted at the right place upstream
- it has to be first (explain how the slot detection works)
- Sources must be injected before usage (obvious)

### Refactoring
State injection can be refactored to avoid duplication when the same state must be passed down to
 distinct component trees.
 
 TODO : insert example. Here we will do it too. (project, user) will also be used by MainPanel 
 so... get it higher at the common ancestor level

### generic, reusable components
Components developed for a specific application usually have to be generalised to make them 
reusable. The generalized component can then be adapted, specialized or parameterized to be used 
for the specific application use case.

For instance, in our application's UI, we have a checkbox on which a click leads to miscellaneous 
actions on the domain model. Abstracting out the actions specific to the domain model, we can 
build a reusable checkbox UI component, where the clicks will emit a dummy action passing on the 
status of the checkbox (checked/unchecked). 

That generic UI checkbox can then be reused in different contexts, within the application, or in 
other applications, by specifying how the clicks translates into actions on the given domain 
model. The UI checkbox component is **adapted** to the application under development.

In other cases, the generalized component will be specialized (the `m` combinator is such a case,
 where the programmer can specialize the reduction of the component tree to one of three patterns).

In yet other cases, the generalized component behaviour will be configured by parameterization 
through the component settings.

In our application, we have identified the following reusable UI components :

- CheckBox
  - for each click on the checkbox, passes the state of that checkbox  
- Editor 
  - allows to define an editable user content zone where the user can modify, save, delete 
  content.

Potential candidates for further refactoring into reusable components are :

- ToggleButton (<em>xor</em> button group component)
- EnterTask (input entry)

A component such as `TaskInfo` is not a fruitful target for a generalization that allow to reuse 
it in other domains, as its behaviour seems very much tied (coupled) to the application's domain 
model.

Ideally, there is already at hand a component library that is already tested, and documented. 
That could be the case for example for UI components, such as those exposed previously. This 
could also be the case if domain experts have succeeded in identifying repeating patterns in 
their domain, and produced a domain-specific component library. In the general case, the software
 designer will have to find and assess the abstraction/generalization opportunities presented to 
 him. Those opportunities are generally identified while refactoring.

For illustration purposes, here is part of the source code for `CheckBox` components.

```javascript
export function CheckBox(sources, settings) {
  const { checkBox: { label:_label, namespace, isChecked } } = settings;
  const checkBoxSelector = '.' + [defaultTo(defaultNamespace, namespace), ++counter].join('-');
  const __label = defaultTo('', _label);

  assertContract(isCheckBoxSettings, [settings.checkBox], `CheckBox : Invalid check box settings! : ${format(settings.checkBox)}`)

  const events = {
    'change' : sources[DOM_SINK].select(checkBoxSelector).events('change')
      .map(ev => ev.target.checked)
  };

  return {
    [DOM_SINK]: $.of(div('.checkbox', [
      label(labelSelector, [
                input([inputSelector, checkBoxSelector].join(''), {
                  "attrs": {
                    "type": "checkbox",
                    "checked": isChecked,
                  }
                }),
                // NOTE : !! snabbdom overload selection algorithm fails if last input is undefined
                span(checkBoxTextSelector, __label)
              ])
    ])),
    isChecked$: events.change
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
TODO summary of benefits : reusability, maintainability, complexity, etc. also well with incremental

 
## Known issues
TODO review this, it is very green
- type safety.
  we have seen how components are combined through component combinators. type of what is in the 
  sinks, should propagate through prisms up but we don't have that, so we let anything flow. 
  Advantage is we wrote a very generic merge function
- expressivity allowed by the syntax
  - For instance, nothing prevents `NavigationSection({},
  [NavigationSection({), [NavigationItem]])` would not give the expected result
    - or would it?
- syntax checking
  - `NavigationSection` could be only permitted to have `NavigationItem` as children or nest other `NavigationSection` and we would not be able to check that the parameters are in line with the 
  expected syntax
