# Componentization
## Abstractions against complexity
We have previously seen that a reactive system can be described by equations involving a reactive function `f` such that `actions = f(state, events)`. In theory, the function `f` is as complex as the specification of the reactive system to implement. In practice, it is often much more so, as dictated by the particular implementation choices made.

Complexity resists to a uniformally useful definition. However, it is generally accepted that there is a component of complexity which cannot be reduced by any particular technique. <em>How many systems do we have? In what convoluted manner are they connected? What the requirement for operating these systems? How many parameters or subtasks are necessary to specify a task?</em>. That complexity increases every year, as the trend is into interconnecting more and more systens to satisfy ever astringent user requirements to do more things in less time. To reuse a commonly used term, we will call this the essential complexity of the system under specification.

Oddly enough, at the same time, on a subjective level, things that were complex last year are less complex now. That subjective but very real component of complexity relates the number of things that cause problems to our ability to deal with them. Our ability to deal with them goes up as we develop better languages, tools, interfaces, architecture, infrastracture, etc. and are able to do more with less. We would define this component of complexity as accidental complexity, and as being the complexity that an implementation approach adds to the essential complexity corresponding to the specification of a system.

As a side note, a user interface itself is precisely an attempt at shielding the user from the complexity of underlying systems so he can focus on the domain at hand and the tasks it encompasses. In other words, the user interface **abstracts** out the underlying system layer. As a matter of fact, most advances against accidental complexity (in **any** field) are made by better and/or more powerful abstractions.

We can list a short range of abstractions taking aim at specific sources of complexity, at the system implementation level : 

- domain : domain modeling
- implementation : domain-specific language
- persistence : databases
- asynchrony : streams (!!)
- memory : garbage collector, constructors
- testing : model-based testing 
- design : componentization
- programming paradigm : declarative programming (including functional programming, dataflow programming, logic programming)  

In the current state of my knowledge, I believe that the most effective levers in mastering complexity are domain modelling, domain-specific languages, and components, glued together by means of declarative programming. 

We will address in what follows componentization.

## What is componentization
The major goal in software construction is to build software that are robust (i.e. performs correctly and does not crash even in unforeseen cases), flexible (i.e. can be used in many seemingly different applications), extensible (i.e. can be extended with minimal if not no modification of existing code), easy to maintain (i.e. to modify to improve performance or fix "bugs"). The main tool of the trade of software developers can be summarized in one word: abstraction.

The abstraction process involves several steps:

- Eliminate all unnecessary details and get to the essential elements of the problem and express them clearly and concisely as invariants.
- Encapsulate that which vary and express them as variants.  The variants of abstractly equivalent behaviors are grouped into appropriate taxonomy of abstract classes and subclasses.
- Define the dynamics of the system in terms of the  interplay between the invariants and the variants.  Sometime the invariants/variants interplays can be straightforward, but more than often they can be subtle like the case when an invariant can be expressed in terms of many variants.

The effort spent in identifying and delineating the invariants from the variants usually leads to the construction of what is called a component framework system where the invariants form the framework and the variants constitute the components.

![Component framework](https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp310/JavaResources/frameworks/frameworks.png)

Hence, in essence, component-frameworks break the system down into variant "components" that represent abstract processing that the system supports. These components are generally thought of as "pluggable" in the sense that the system can be configured with a set of components to accomplish a particular task or set of tasks.   In many systems, the components can dynamically swapped in and out.   The framework, on the other hand, is the invariant "superstructure" that manages the components, providing services to each component that, when combined with the services/behaviors supplied by that component, create the net behavior defined by that component in that framework.    The framework has the effect of decoupling or isolating the components from each other since it the component interactions are handled by the framework in a manner that is opaque to the components.

## Benefits
As previously mentioned, the benefits are : 

- productivity, coming from a component framework design targeted at reuse, and composability
- readability
  - when a given component addresses a specific concern, which is not addressed elsewhere (i.e. achieving separation of concerns), the reactive system is easier to reason about
- maintainability
  - components can be replaced easily, by a better or equivalent version  
- reliability
  - in the measure that components and the component framework are properly tested and reliable, the surface area on which bugs can attach themselves is considerably lower

## Words of caution
The main goal of componentization, which is achieving productivity through reuse, has however often proved elusive.

## Component framework
A component framework or platform provides both a systematic method to construct components, possibly from other components (namely dealing with interfacing, binding and interactions between components), and a systematic interface between component and the component framework, by which components can be introspected, instantiated, executed, destroyed (namely dealing with component lifecycle)[^A classification framework for software component models].

The first figure shows a classification framework for software component models, emphasizing the miscellaneous responsibilities of a component model. We will not mention here the third point (extra-functional properties).

### Proposed component framework
We have seen previously that to implement a reactive system we need :

- a reactive function `f` linking actions to events
- an interface with the systems through which actions intended by the user must be performed
- an interface by which the reactive system receives its events

Our component framework will be inspired by `cyclejs` framework. A component will be a procedure `f :: Sources -> Settings -> Sinks`, where :

- `Sources` contains any necessary accessor/factory methods to the internal state of the framework and relevant events
- `Settings` represents the parameterization concern of the component behaviour
- `Sinks` holds the computed action representations in response to incoming events

Note that `f` here is not in general a pure function, as typically `f` is accessing the external world to read events from it. We will still call `f` the reactive function, by abuse of language. It would be easy to write `f = compose(g, h)` where `h :: Sources -> Settings -> Events` and `g :: Events -> Settings -> Sinks`, so that `g` is a pure function. We however follow `cyclejs` choice here and accept an impure reactive function, for reasons we will detail thereafter. 

The component framework exposes an interface to its components by which it receives the actions to be perfomed : `Sinks :: HashMap<SinkName, Sink>`, is to be matched with `Drivers :: HashMap<SinkName, Driver>`, where a `Driver :: Sink -> Source` takes responsibility for the **execution** of actions passed through the **matching** sink, and passing up the eventual results of such actions as an event into the reactive system.

The component framework also exposes the interface which the reactive system receives its events : `Sources :: HashMap<SourceName, Source>`, where `Source` is anything presenting an interface to access events and state of external systems of interest. `Source` can, for instance, be a parameterizable event factory (events obtained from DOM listeners, etc.). `SourceName` is a moniker uniquely referencing the corresponding source of events.

The component framework connects together identical `SourceName` and `SinkName`, so that a driver corresponding to a given `SinkName` will output the result of the actions it executes as events with the same moniker as a `SourceName`.

In the context of this component framework, component composition is simply function composition, with message-passing/dataflow through streams and a port-based interface emulated by the monikers `SinkName`, `SourceName`.

We will review in what follows parallel composition, sequential composition, parametricity and genericity, all of which being concerns incorporated into what we term component combinators.

#### Parallel composition
Parallel composition in our context is based on expressing the reactive function `f` as the combination of functions, each of which captures a smaller and ideally isolated part of the overall `f`'s complexity. 

The bet is that :

- the smaller functions will lead to lower complexity, 
- that complexity will be low enough to be addressed satisfactorily at the smaller function level, 
- `f` can be recombined in a systematic way without loss in specification from the smaller functions
- it will be possible to encapsulate a large class of reactive subsystems into reusable generic components, which can then be parameterized to reflect the targeted reactive subsystem at hand. 

In short, we want a `combine :: Array<Component> -> Component`, where :

- `f`, the reactive function is a `Component`
- `f` can be obtained by applying `combine` to other reactive functions 
	- `f = combine([f1, f2, f3...])`

Note that :

- the `combine` function can take any extra arguments, in which case, by uncurrying, it is always possible to come back the canonical `combine` form shown previously.
- As any component used to derive another component can itself have been derived, parallel composition naturally leads to the manipulation of component trees
	- `f = combine([f1, f2...])`
	- `f = combine([combine([f1.1, f1.2, f1.3...]), combine([f2.1, f2.2, f2.3...])...])`
	- etc.

There are usually many ways to perform that decomposition. The idea in every case is to reach functions `fm.n...` whose complexity is easily manageable. If we understand that part of complexity of such `f...` emanates from the top-level `f`, while another part stems from the interaction of `f...`s with the larger reactive system, we see that there is a sweet spot where the function is 'small' enough to be manageable but not too small so it has to be coupled with many other `f...`s to achieve a given functionality (coupling increases complexity).

### Sequential composition
**TODO**
We want `combine :: Array<Component> -> Component`, where :

- combine([f]) = f
- combine([f, g]) 
  - only defined when f and g have at least one matching output/input
  - connect input to output TODO show some diagram - ah already did
  - if not defined returns empty component, the component who does nothing OR ERROR??

### Component combinators
A component combinator is a function of the type `Combinator :: Settings -> Array<Component> -> Component`. The signator is basically the formerly presented `combine` signature to which `Settings` have been added to allow to parameterize the behaviour of the combinator.

Those combinators are themselves specialization of a generic combinator, here called `m`, with `m :: CombinatorSpecs -> Settings -> Array<Component> -> Component`, which can also be written `m :: CombinatorSpecs -> Combinator`. That is, one can see `m` both as a combinator factory, or a component factory.

We have so far implemented a list of combinators which allow to realize the following composition :

- merge reactive functions
- switch reactive functions according to events
- recursively switching reactive functions according to route (i.e. nested routing)
- merge a list of reactive function based on a template and incoming array
- extend a reactive function to process additional events or add extra parameterization
- build a set of reactive functions into a state machine

We have not so far implemented specific combinators for sequential composition.

### Example
give an example of one reactive system with a reactive function within the framework. And then the same reactive function broken down in two
no code, use shapes and colors to represent sources and actions, maybe imagine an animation to represent the live system?

### TODO
a lot of things following to remove or put elsewhere:
-Component adaptation goes to `m` rationale or documentation

also refactor `m` code to make more apparent the aspect weaving
cf. On Interplay between separation of concerns and genericity, and ART language example

## cycle and my library
main pattern

f = InjectSourcesAndSettings(sourcesAndSettings, [f1,
  f1.1,
  f1.2,
  ...
]);

## Breakdown phase
`f` is componentized into (`f1, f1.1,...`) :

- `actions = f(states, events)`
- `actions1 = f1(states1, events1)`, where :
  - `f1` is derived from `f`'s specifications
   - `states1` is derived from `states` and `f1`'s specification
  - `events1` is derived from `states` and `f1`'s specification


### Genericity, parametricity and reuse
At the core of reusability of components is the ability to design components implementing a behaviour which is generic enough to cover a large set of contexts, and parameterizable enough to be customized at design-time or run-time without modification.

In this effort, we will address the parameterization concern with a specific parameter (often termed as `settings`) passed to the reusable component factories or combinators. For instance a `CheckBox` component implementing the generic reactive system made of a checkbox which when clicked emits an action including its checked/unchecked state,  could be written to be parameterized in appearance/style (allowing to customize the checkbox background for example).

Genericity at the component level is ad-hoc and can leverage the usual polymorphism techniques. INSERT example.

Component polymorphism and component customization work synergistically to provide a powerful reuse mechanism. This however naturally makes the life of the component designer more difficult, in order to make the life of the component user simpler.

In the frame of this componentization effort, passing settings to component is realized by `InjectSourcesAndSettings` combinator.

### Component adaptation
The states and events streams of `f1` are linked to those of `f`, by inheritance or transformation. ??TODO

- adapting the inputs
	- `InjectSources`
	- `InjectSourcesAndSettings`
- adapting the outputs
	- none for now, just in `ListOf` we have a `sinkname` mapping function, maybe that could be a setting in every combinator, i.e. another option for m?? but then I would need the symetric feature for mapping inputs, and then inputs and mapped inputs are both in settings, so do I remove the inputs and keep only the mapped inputs etc. to think about, it is not so simple, both case could be valid, and having both increase complexity and surface of API

## Example of specs as sequence [(event,action)]
Counter : input box = counter in DB, click -> increase counter and save in db
2 counters for 2 dbs, click increase both counters
- `actions = f(state, events)`
- `State :: (DB1_STATE, DB2_STATE)`
- `Events :: ButtonClick1 | ButtonClick2`
- f(state, click) -> Increase Db1State state, Increase Db2State state (2 actions)
	- f1 (DB1_STATE, ButtonClick1 )
	- f2(DB2_STATE, ButtonClick2)
	- f = f1+f2

So State -> focus -> lens
So Events -> choose -> prism

TODO : explain that better
INSERT example

SHOW how thermite framework, elm framework, cycle can be derived as variation on the reactive formulation

“A software component is a unit of composition with 
contractually specified interfaces and explicit context
dependencies only. A software component can be
deployed independently and is subject to composition
by third parties”

## thoughts on constant and variable part of the state
State may further be segmented into :

- constants : constants are passed through use of a segregated `settings` variable
- variable : the variable part of the state may be passed through what is coined as **behaviours** in Conall Eliott's FRP.

State is passed down the component hierarchy via `InjectSources`, `InjectSourcesAndSettings` combinators

**TODO** : clarify the whole/part relation of states. States here is a stream, so that will be a stream which is a tree of substates. It all comes down to the derivation relation : focus (sub state, i.e. lens) or extend (new state type, i.e. prism)
**TODO** :  actually the settings that I pass is because of the necessity to customize generic components (generic UI components for example). Are they also representing constant state?? To think about

## Recombining phase
`actions` is recombined through `actions1`, `actions1.1`, etc. and the help of `combine` operators.

In the particular case of the 'update screen' action, recombination is performed based on insertion markers, called slots (following the web component terminology). Those slots are marked via the `InSlot` combinator.

## Summary
In summary, reactive systems can be specified by means of a reactive function associating inputs to actions. That reactive function can be obtained by composition of reactive functions from smaller reactive systems. 

A good decomposition or factoring is one : 

- which ensures for each subsystem a reduction in complexity
(simpler specifications, smaller size of the reactive system, few interactions with other subsystems i.e. intercomponent dependency)
- which can be reassembled in a way that is easy to reason about and trace
- can be parameterized without modification (open-closed principle), so futures changes in the overall reactive system have a higher change to result mainly in changes in parameterization of subsystems.
- highly cohesive, loosely coupled to ensure adaptability : 80% of software engineering deals with maintaining or releasing new versions. The cost of redesigning each of such adoptable components (or replacing by a better component) must be minimized.

In our reactive system, `cyclejs` context, for component construction, simple functions are used, exposing a fixed interface, differentiating parameterization concern and dataflow concern in their inputs; a port metaphor is used for component sequential composition ; combinators are used for parallel composition. Component lifecycle is handled by the framework which by means of <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em> functionalities.
  
  TODO : talk about the combinator roles in the construction of component!!! talk about stream and dataflow that is an important part of the interface specification
