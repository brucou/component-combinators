# The case for `m`, the component factory

Componentization pursues three goals :

- reuse - the most important factor of productivity gain
- separation of concerns - which fosters quality and maintainability
- using a limited number of operations and atomic components to build a large
   set of components - reducing complexity and increasing readability

At the core of this approach there is a combining function which takes a number of 
components and derives
 a new component, i.e `combine :: Array<Component> -> Component`. That
 function can take any extra arguments, in which case, by uncurrying, it is always possible to come
  back the canonical `combine` form shown previously.
  As any component used to derive another component can itself have been derived, 
  componentization naturally leads to the manipulation of component trees.

  The function `m` is a such a combinator, specialized to the domain of reactive systems's user 
  interface, which abstracts out a limited set of operations/patterns by which a component tree 
  can be composed.
   
   The speculated benefits are :
   
   - linking a bottom-up user interface design with a bottom-up user-interface implementation
   - making the component tree explicit which allows for top-down processing (more on that 
   elsewhere)

TODO : examples to give. `m([m([a]), m([b])])` etc is equivalent to m-fold ([[a,b]]). This 
means that [[a,b]] is the structure, and `m` is a folding function. There  
could be other interesting folding functions.
TODO : talk about webcomponents, how this only touches the view part. `m` touches all actions

In what follows :

- `m` will be interchangeably termed as combinator, component factory, utility function, or 
helper function.
- In the specified domain, components will be understood as `:: Sources -> Settings -> 
Actions`, i.e. functions which :

- take a `Sources` data structure which contains a way to receive event from event sources
- take a `Settings` data structure which allows to parameterize the behaviour of the component
- return an `Actions` data structure which encodes the actions to be performed by the reactive
system under study.

**NOTE** : The type definition for components is adapted from the one used in the reactive 
framework `cyclejs`. We added the `Settings` parameter to cleanly separate the 
parameterization/configuration concern from the reactive input processing concern. We believe 
this is an important, though trivial, design change, which allows for better readability. This is as a 
matter of fact in line with other major componentization efforts such as `React` which uses `props`
 to that same parameterization effect.
 
# API

As explained before, we have `parentComponent = combine (childrenComponents)` - (cf. Fig `combine`).

![combine](http://i.imgur.com/C7y9x2A.png). 

From the signature of the `combine`, we can deduce that the computation of the actions for the 
parent component can only involve :

- computations independent from the children `makeOwnSinks:: Sources -> Settings -> Actions`

![makeOwnSinks](http://i.imgur.com/zKruDeA.png)

- computations dependent from some or all children :
  - the most general form is `computeSinks :: makeOwnSinks -> Array<Component> -> Sources -> 
  Settings -> Actions`
  
  ![computeSinks](http://i.imgur.com/huxKPTJ.png)
  
  - when `Actions` combine well together (monoidal type), a common pattern is to build the
  parent actions from the list of both children actions and parent actions through merge. When 
  the `Sources` data structure only serves to generate children component actions, the
  general form can be specialized to :
  `mergeSinks :: Actions -> Array<Actions> -> Settings -> Actions`
  
  ![mergeSinks - function](http://i.imgur.com/hW97jzn.png)
  
  - going further in the specialization, under the additional hypothesis that `Actions` can be
  broken down into a product type, i.e. for instance, `Actions :: HashMap<ActionName,
  ActionStream>`, where a given `ActionStream` can only be merged with another `ActionStream` of
  the same action name, we derive the most specialized form :
    - `mergeSinks :: MergeActionsSpecs -> Actions -> Array<Actions> -> Settings -> Actions`, 
    where `MergeActionsSpecs :: HashMap<ActionName, MergeActionStreamsFn>`, 
    where `MergeActionStreamsFn :: ActionStream -> Array<ActionStream> -> Settings -> ActionStream`
   
   ![mergeSinks - specs](http://i.imgur.com/kv87fhl.png)

The API of `m` derives directly from these considerations.

The `m` factory function have several signatures according to the form chosen to specify the 
combining function :

 - generic form
 - specialized form
 - most-specialized form

Other specification parameters for the combining function are the same for all forms :
 
 - contract checking
 - sources and settings adjustment
 - children-independent sinks generation

In addition to the combining function specification, the `m` factory also receives settings which
 parameterize its behavior, and naturally the array of components from which it computes its 
 resulting component. 
 
 In what follows, the array of components will be termed as children 
 component, while the component returned by the `m` factory will be called parent component. We 
 will use `Sinks` as a type synonym for `Actions`, and `Sink` as a type synonym for 
 `ActionStream`. This is to reuse the terminology put in vogue by `cyclejs`. 

## `m :: CombineGenericSpecs -> Settings -> Array<Component>`
### Types
- `Component :: Sources -> Settings -> Sinks`
- `CombineGenericSpecs :: Record {` 
  - `makeOwnSinks :: Sources -> Settings -> Sinks` 
  - `computeSinks :: makeOwnSinks -> Array<Component> -> Sources -> Settings -> Sinks`
  - `makeLocalSources :: Optional < Sources -> Settings -> Sources >`
  - `makeLocalSettings :: Optional < Settings -> Settings >`
  - `checkPreConditions :: Optional < Sources -> Settings -> Boolean >`
  - `checkPostConditions :: Optional < Sinks -> Boolean >`
  - `}`

### Contracts
Aside from the type contracts, there is the possibility to configure user-defined contracts 
(pre- and post-conditions), which are predicates who return true if the contract is fulfilled. 
There is no further contracts.

### Description
The `m`  factory returns a component computed as follows :

1. contracts are checked
  - if one contract fails, an exception is raised
2. children-independent sinks are generated by calling `makeOwnSinks` (default value is null)
3. additional sources and settings are generated via `makeLocalSources`, and `makeLocalSettings`
  - `makeLocalSources` returns the extra sources to add to the `sources` passed in parameter to the 
  computed parent component. If not present, no extra sources are added. `makeLocalSources` is 
  called with the sources passed to the parent component and the merged settings 
  - `makeLocalSettings` returns the extra settings to add to the settings passed in parameter to 
  the computed parent component. 
    - If not present, no extra settings is added. 
    - The local settings are computed from the merge of the computed parent component settings and 
  the `m` factory settings. 
    - The local settings added have the lowest priority in case of conflict (cf. section on 
    settings prioritization). 
    - The settings passed in parameter to the computed parent component have the maximum priority.
    - the computed parent component settings have a priority between the two.
4. the `computeSinks` reducing function computes the parent sinks from the children independent 
sinks, merged sources, merged settings, and array of children. 

## `m :: CombineAllSinksSpecs -> Settings -> Array<Component> -> Component`
### Types
- `CombineAllSinksSpecs :: Record {` 
  - `makeOwnSinks :: Sources -> Settings -> Sinks` 
  - `mergeSinks :: makeOwnSinks -> Array<Sinks> -> Settings -> Sinks`
  - `makeLocalSources :: Optional < Sources -> Settings -> Sources >`
  - `makeLocalSettings :: Optional < Settings -> Settings >`
  - `checkPreConditions :: Optional < Sources -> Settings -> Boolean >`
  - `checkPostConditions :: Optional < Sinks -> Boolean >`
  - `}`

### Contracts
This signature fulfills the same contract as the general signature.

### Description
The `m`  factory returns a component computed as follows :

1-3. same as in the general signature
4. Sinks are computed for each child component from the merged sources and merged settings.
5. Those sinks are later reduced by `mergeSinks` into the parent component sinks.

## `m :: CombinePerSinkSpecs -> Settings -> Array<Component> -> Component`
### Types
- `Sinks :: HashMap<SinkName, Sink>` 
- `Sink :: Stream <*>` 
- `CombinePerSinkSpecs :: Record {` 
  - `makeOwnSinks :: Sources -> Settings -> Sinks`
  - `SinkMergeFn :: Sink -> Array<Sink> -> Settings -> Sinks`
  - `mergeSinks :: HashMap<SinkName, SinkMergeFn>`
  - `makeLocalSources :: Optional < Sources -> Settings -> Sources >`
  - `makeLocalSettings :: Optional < Settings -> Settings >`
  - `checkPreConditions :: Optional < Sources -> Settings -> Boolean >`
  - `checkPostConditions :: Optional < Sinks -> Boolean >`
  - `}`

### Contracts
This signature fulfills the same contract as the general signature.

### Description
The `m`  factory returns a component computed as follows :

1-3. same as in the general signature
4. Sinks are computed for each child component from the merged sources, and merged settings.
5. For each sink (uniquely identified by `sinkName::SinkName`) :
  - if there is a merge function defined in `mergeSinks` for that `sinkName`, that function is used
   to compute the resulting parent component sink from the children-independent sink, the children 
  components' sinks, and the merged settings.
  - If not, a default merge function is used :
    - Default DOM merge function will merge the `VTree` from the children components INSIDE the `Vtree` 
    from the children-independent DOM sink
      - if there is DOM sink, it return `null`
      - if there is no children-independent DOM sink, then it returns the children VTrees wrapped
       in a `div` VNode
      - if there is a children-independent DOM sink, and there is no children DOM sinks, then it 
      returns the children-independent DOM sink 
      - if there is a children-independent DOM sink, and there are children DOM sinks, then it 
      returns a VTree in which the children DOM sinks are children of the children-independent 
      DOM VNode and appended to any existing children
    - Default non-DOM merge function will merge the children-independent sink together with the 
    children sinks via simple stream merge (i.e. `Rx.Observable.merge`)

# Examples
In this section, we are going to show miscellaneous examples of use of componentization with the 
`m` factory.
Most of those examples will be inspired from already-existent UI component library, such as 
`Semantic UI`.

## Event factory component
`Events = m(EventFactorySpec, EventFactorySettings, childrenComponents)`
`Events = mEventFactory(EventFactorySettings, childrenComponents)`

This example makes use of :
- `checkPreConditions`
- `makeOwnSinks`
- `mergeSinks`
- utility function `defaultMergeSinkFn`

### Description
This component allows to create events from event sources. For ease of reasoning and 
maintainability, the created events should be coupled to the DOM representation generated by the 
children component. There is however no enforcement of such property.
The created events will be mixed with the sinks returned from the children components.

Contracts:
- an event sink generated from event sources MUST NOT conflict with a sink with the same key from 
the children component
- there MUST be an `events` property in the settings object. The corresponding object MAY be 
empty (event factory created no events).

###  EventFactorySettings
- `{`
  - `events : {`
    - `custom : {eventName : (sources, settings) =>  event$},` 
    - `DOM : { DomEventName : {selectorDesc : 'selector'}}`
  - `}`
- `}`

Note that all events generated from the DOM remove the default DOM side effect with 
`preventDefault`.

#### `events.DOM` property
`events.DOM` is a list of selectors that MAY be later used in the children components, 
for instance to uniquely identify the target of an event. This allow to parameterize the coupling 
between the parent and the children components, i.e. between the events and the event targets.
`events.DOM` is also used to set an event listener on the matching DOM element (as specified by 
`selector`). Corresponding listened-to events will be streamed through a sink with identifier 
`[selectorDesc]_[DomEventName]`.

For instance :
```
{
  events : {
    DOM : {
      click : {
        PriceSelector : '.block--modifier-value'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

will lead to registering a listener on the DOM element(s) identified by the selector `
.block--modifier-value`. As the events factory parameterization is inherited by 
children (through settings), children components can reference within their DOM tree the passed 
on selector (`settings.events.DOM.click.PriceSelector`). Repetition is avoided and the  
coupling of behaviour and visual representation is made explicit.

#### `events.custom` property
This allows for generating a custom stream of events from the event source and settings.

For instance :
```
{
  events : {
    custom : (sources, settings) => sources.motionSensor.zipWith(sources.locationSensor)
  }
}
```

The resulting stream of events is passed through the sink `eventName`.

### Source code
TODO : implement, include a link to the code on github, and excerpts from it with `...` for low 
relevant part of the code, maybe explain a bit or better do that in the source code in fact. 
Include a link to the tests

## Button component
`Button = m(ButtonComponentSpec, ButtonComponentSettings, childrenComponents)`

###  ButtonComponentSettings
  - class
  - emphasis : 'primary, secondary, positive, negative, basic'
  - tabIndex
  - animated : {'', fade, vertical}
  - label : {text, position : 'left, right'}
  - icon : for instance 'cloud' - must be mapped to an actual icon previously
  - visualState : 'active, disabled, loading' 
  - social : 'facebook, twitter, google, vk, linkedin, instagram, youtube'
  - size 'mini tiny small medium large big huge massive'
  - layout : 'compact, fluid, attached, top attached, bottom attached, left attached, right attached'
  - listenTo : event list such as click, hover, etc.
  
  TODO : contract for the settings
     - DONT CHECK NO EXTRA COMPONENTS (could inherit settings from elsewhere)
     - check values for property are in the corresponding enum list
     - dont forget that a property can be present but undefined, and that is different from the 
     property not being present

### Source code
TODO : implement, include a link to the code on github, and excerpts from it with `...` for low 
relevant part of the code. That means include ButtonComponentSpec as comments in the source code

### ButtonComponentSpec
The specifications are as follow :
- The component MAY listen to any of the regular DOM event associated to a button:
  - click, hover, etc.
- A button MAY have content inside, which is any valid HTML
  - hence a button children component can be a simple text (TODO : do I need a text component? or
   mText operator - it is the same I think)

We hence have :
  - `makeOwnSinks` which generates `<div class = 'ui button ...'> </div>`
    - class list will depend on settings
  - `childrenSinks` merged DOM which correspond to `Content` in 
  `<div class = 'ui button ...'> Content </div>`
    - that is the default DOM merge
    - we keep also the non-DOM sinks returned by the children
    - content MAY be empty

#### makeOwnSinks
- div ({class : analyzeSettings(settings)}) TODO check that it is class with snabbdom

That should be it

#### demo
Button = curry(m)(ButtonSpecs)
Show = curry(m)({}) // simplest component to apply default sink merges
ShowContent = curry(mDiv)({class : 'visible content'}) // mdiv = lifting div(...) into a `m` component, OR
HideContent = curry(mDiv)({class : 'hidden content'}) // polymorphic, last arg can be text or [Comp]

UI = [
  Button({animated:true}, [
    ShowContent('Next'), 
    HideContent([
      mIcon({class : 'right arrow icon'}) // I could remove icon as it is implicit in mIcon
    ])
  ]),
  Button({animated: 'vertical'}, [
    HideContent('Shop'),
    ShowContent ([
      mIcon({class : 'shop icon'})
    ])
  ]),
  Button({animated: 'fade'}, [
    ShowContent ('Sign-up for a Pro account'),
    HideContent ([
      mText('$12.99 a month')
    ])
  ]),
]

demo - Show({}, UI)

This should produce the following HTML code : 

```html 
<div class="ui animated button" tabindex="0">
  <div class="visible content">Next</div>
  <div class="hidden content">
    <i class="right arrow icon"></i>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="ui vertical animated button" tabindex="0">
  <div class="hidden content">Shop</div>
  <div class="visible content">
    <i class="shop icon"></i>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="ui animated fade button" tabindex="0">
  <div class="visible content">Sign-up for a Pro account</div>
  <div class="hidden content">
    $12.99 a month
  </div>
</div>
```

## Button group component
  - or : 'true, false'
  - layout : 'attached, top attached, bottom attached, left attached, right attached, vertical. '
  - icon : 'true, false'
  - equalWidth : 'three, five'
  - labeled : 'true, false' - only in conjunction with icon? i.e. labeled icon
  - size : cf. property for button component, here applies to the whole group
  - emphasis : cf. property for button component, here applies to the whole group
  - listenTo : event list such as click, hover, etc.
  
  
TODO : give examples with list of link components : DOM, router sink, must be merged, and with a 
tab interface?

# Possible improvements
- should make `localSettings`, settings which are only applied locally, i.e. for `makeOwnSinks`, 
and not passed down to the children. That would allow to customize those own sinks as a function 
of the settings from construction time (inherited from parent and ancestors) at runtime. Settings
 for now are inherited as `parent <- grand parent <- ... patriarch`.
- make `settings`
