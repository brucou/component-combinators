After working on a pretty large cyclejs application, I singled out four areas of interest to 
achieve a decent productivity when working in the large with cyclejs. I finally completed a draft 
for the first step, which is a refined component model, extracted and abstracted from the 20K+ 
lines of javascript I was extending and maintaining. That component model for cycle in many ways is
 an extension of that of react, and incorporates a DOM slot mechanism Ã  la web components. It works 
pretty nicely even though the whole thing is still but a proof of concept. 

This is a relatively large piece of work, so expect to not being able to get the details on the 
first read. Hopefully though, you should get the general concept relatively fast. I invite you to 
have a look, check the demos, documentation and articles, and let me know what you think. The entry point would be the README : https://github.com/cyclejs-community/component-combinators
