Web development is naturally focused on public sites, and with public sites, page load is king. The longer the page load, the longer the visitor contemplates hitting the back button. This is why most JS frameworks try to be minimal: More JS → higher bounce rate.

However, in private web apps, the user is not going to bounce if initial load takes 3 seconds (see gmail loading bar). Also, since users stick around, its actually subsequent load times that are perceived as performance. So, in private apps more JS is not a big deal. What benefits can we get with more JS? We can get a unified and coherent framework for constructing complex UI with standard components, so we can stop reinventing the wheel.

Private apps also tend to be more complex, with complicated model hierarchies accompanied by large numbers of Views for displaying and modifying different sets of related models. Simplifying the model can only go so far — You're restricted by the inherent complexity of the app's domain. Rather than oversimplifying Plumage provides a systematic way to manage complexity in constructing and manipulating your model and view hierarchies.
