# Combinators
- Use Pipe({},[WithEvents(...), WithState(...), ComputeActions(...)]) would be any leaf
      // component including generic or ad-hoc components.
      // InjectSources would be state visible in all the hierarchy, while WithState only visible
      // in Pipe - ComputeActions
      // Those three components actually are the same component sources -> settings, what changes
      // is meaning i.e. meta like log
- make combinator ForEachOfList as shortcut for ForEach(...ListOf(...))

# Core
- think about work around for isolation, components need to pass their click free of concerns
- m : write a better doc to explain settings inheritance, and put in the docs not in the code
  - write an interactive application with update of the three possible settings
- m : design better trace information
  - for instance outer trace could be concatenated to inner trace to trace also the component 
  hierarchy
- all components : replace singular treatment for DOM into behaviourSinkNames, sinkNames
  - all behaviourSinkNames must give a zero value (for DOM : $.of(null)
  - but really find a non-DOM example and investigate, it is not so simple
- NTH : Router : route params property name could be configured in settings, to think about
- NTH : Router : route params could be directly passed as settings to children components
- TODO : FSM : a bunch of them pending
- NOTE : run the router only with cycle history (done in AllIn demo)
- TODO : for all components, decide if I pass the settings of the combinator downstream!!
   - for instance, sinkNames is good to pass downstream, but slot would not be!!
- TODO : change InjectSourcesAndSettings so that factory returns both sources and settings so
 one function call factory(sources, settings) -> {sources : {sources hash}, settings: new
 settings}
- TODO : cleanup and break up utils, too many thigns there, look for cohesion
- TODO : add examples for :
   - authentication : take it from firebase sparks
- TODO : see how to translate that https://github.com/Shopify/draggable?
- TODO : what about animations? How does that play with vDom?

# Build/devop
- TODO : move to rollup? why lib/rxcc.min.js is so big ? because rx?
- TODO : also review the structure of the repository (m_helpers? history_driver? where to put 
runTestScenario?)
- TODO : get all working with latest version of snabdomm, and cycle-run etc.

# Documentation/Example
- for new comers
// When trying to expand this example to a proper app, it quickly becomes an avalanche
// of unsolvable questions:
//
//   How do I keep track of all the streams?
//   Where do I keep state?
//   Where and how do I propagate my HTTP requests?
//   How do my child components communicate with parents and vice versa?
//   How do I deal with lists of things?
//   How do I communicate between components in different parts of the page?
//   How do I respond to and possibly propagate errors (anywhere: HTTP responses, form field
// values etc.)?
//   How do I do forms and form validation?
//   How do I...?
//   //

- angular app
// TODO:  1. draggable first
// TODO:  2. tags
// TODO:  3. scroll
// TODO : understand the plugin thing (used for task info)
