/**
 * Returns a component specified by :
 * - a component definition object (nullable)
 * - outer settings (nullable)
 * - children components (or none)
 * Component definition properties :
 * - mergeSinks : computes resulting sinks or a specific sinks according to
 * configuration. See type information
 * - computeSinks : computes resulting sinks by executing the
 * children component and parent and merging the result
 * - checkPreConditions : default to nothing
 * - checkPostConditions : default to checking all sinks are observables or `null`
 * - makeLocalSources : default -> null
 * - makeLocalSettings : default -> null
 * - makeOwnSinks : -> default null
 *
 * # Algorithm
 * The factored algorithm which derives sinks from sources is as follows :
 * - merging current `sources` with extra sources if any (configured with `makeLocalSources`)
 * - computing children sinks by executing the children components on the
 * merged sources
 * - computing some parent-component-specific sinks (i.e. that computation depends only on the
 * `sources` and `settings` parameter)
 * - merging the parent sinks with the children sinks
 *
 * There are two specification formats for the final component, according to the level of
 * granularity desired - the short spec and the detailed spec :
 * - short spec :
 *   one function `computeSinks` which computes the sinks from a children-independent sink
 *   factory, the sources, settings and children components. This is basically a big function
 *   which takes all information at disposal to compute the computed component sinks in one
 *   go. As such, this function gathers several concerns (source fetching, sinks creation,
 *   sinks merging, etc.).
 *   The rationale behind that function is that sometimes one needs complete control over the
 *   creation of the generation of the sinks for the computed component. Because the array of
 *   children components is passed directly (vs. passing the post-execution children
 *   components sinks), that function has total freedom over deciding how to compute
 *   and incorporate the children sinks.
 *   For the short spec, the relevant properties are :
 *   - `computeSinks`, `makeOwnSinks`,
 *   - the user-defined factories, the user-defined contracts
 * - detailed spec :
 *   For the detailed spec, the relevant properties are :
 *   - `makeOwnSinks`, `mergeSinks`,
 *   - the user-defined factories, the user-defined contracts
 *   TODO : in fact, the dichotomy short/detailed is not really valid - follow terminology of m docs
 *
 * Children components and local sinks factory functions will be called with the extended sources
 * (i.e. provided sources merged with locally computed sources, and settings resulting from
 * the three-way settings merge described thereafter).
 *
 * The goal of these functions is as follows:
 * - `makeOwnSinks(sources, settings)` : computation of children-independent sinks, i.e.
 * specific to that `m` factory call.
 * - `mergeSinks(ownSinks, childrenSinks, localSettings)` : outputs computed component sinks
 * as a result of the children-independent sinks, the children-generated sinks, and the
 * three-way merged settings received by the `m` factory and its run-time environment.
 *
 * @param {DetailedComponentDef|ShortComponentDef} componentDef
 * @param {Settings} _settings
 * @param {Array<Component>} children
 *
 * @returns {Component}
 * @throws when type- and user-specified contracts are not satisfied
 *
 * # User-defined contracts
 * Contract functions allows to perform additional user-defined contract checking before computing
 * the component, for instance :
 * - check that sources have the expected properties
 * - check that the computed sinks have the expected type or properties
 *
 * # Sources
 * The factory-computer component is called with a `sources` argument which is the result of
 * the merge between the `sources` argument passed to the factory and the `sources` resulting
 * from the local sources factory (via `makeLocalSources`). In case of conflict, the local
 * sources factory has the lowest precedence vs. the factory sources.
 * It is important to note that this local sources factory function is called with a settings
 * parameter which ignores the local settings factory! Hence local settings cannot influence
 * the creation of sources.
 * In fact, there is almost no cases where an extra source might depend on settings. In the
 * vast majority of the cases, we expect the local sources factory to be independent of any
 * settings.
 *
 * # Settings
 * The output component returned by the `m` utility receives settings (at call time), termed in
 * what follows as inner settings. The `m` utility also receives settings, termed here as
 * outer settings. Any computation performed by the output component will be equivalent to
 * that of the same output component who would have received a merge of the inner and outer
 * settings. This allows the component factory `m` to parameterize/customize the behaviour of
 * its computed component. This in particular means that the outer settings take precedence
 * over the inner settings in case of conflict.
 *
 * Such merging conflicts are to be avoided in general. Having the computed component
 * behaviour depending on a parameter external to its definition means that one can no longer
 * reason about the component behaviour in isolation, but needs to know about the component's
 * context (position in the component tree).
 * There are however some valid cases when the equivalent of environment variables needs to be
 * passed down to components. Rather than explicitly passing those parameters to every
 * component individually down the component tree, it is enough to pass it once at some level,
 * and those parameters will be :
 * - visible at every lower level
 * - cannot be altered by lower-level components
 *
 * Those 'environment variables' should reflect concerns which are fairly orthogonal to the
 * component (leaf indexing, sinks signature, etc.), so that they do not interact with the
 * intended behaviour of the component.
 *
 * To complicate the matter further, as a part of the component definition, one can include
 * what is term here as computed settings (derived from the merge of inner and outer
 * settings). Those computed (at call time) settings are merged to the other two and have the
 * lowest precedence level of all. They aim at covering fairly narrow cases, and allow for
 * temporary customization of component behaviour (another call can result in a different
 * behaviour for the component).
 *
 * So :
 * - settings passed to the `m` factory are permanent and inherited by both the computed
 * component, and the children components which are part of the `m` factory definition
 * - the computed component is called with settings which are automatically passed down the
 * children components passed to the factory
 * - the children component behaviour can, if there is no conflict with existing settings,
 * be customized further by the local settings factory, which is a part of the `m` factory
 * definition
 *
 * TODO : this only clarifies the precedence between the factory and its computed component.
 * It might just be the opporiste of what is described there... because of tree evaluation order
 * There is a third case which is that the computed component receives also settings from
 * its upper hierarchy... To be detailed with examples, that\s the best given the three-way dance.
 * Also note that the settings passed down to children component from
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * Source contracts are checked before merging incoming sources and user-configured sources
 * Settings contracts are checked on the final settings for the component, which is the result
 * of the merge of the outer settings passed through the `m` utility, and the inner settings
 * passed to the output component.
