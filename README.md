# Motivation 
Around 18 months ago, while working on what is the largest cyclejs codebase I know of 
(~20K lines of code), I realized how hard it was to actually make sense **quickly** of a large 
cycle-js application. Focusing on the issues derived largely from cyclejs usage :

- a large portion of the code was stream handling originating from the use of components and the 
necessity to wire them together. The domain logic, and as a result, the application logic was 
lost into a sea of streams' sometimes-cryptic operations. 
- extra confusion due to parametrizing components with streams which were not streams, but constants
lifted into streams, adding to the noise
- **modifying, fixing and extending that code proved to be a gamble**, with any debugging sessions 
counted in hours (to be fair, the complete absence of documentation explained a lot of that)
- hard to figure out quickly, **with certainty** the workflow that the application was 
implementing (you know, multi-step processes where any step may fail and need to backtrack), let alone add new
 logical branches (error recovery...)

And yet, while that application was large, it cannot really be said to be a particularly complex 
application. Rather it was the standard CRUD application which is 90% of business applications today. No fancy animations (no animations at all in fact if I remember well), adaptive ui as the only ux trick, otherwise mostly fields and forms, a remote 
database, and miscellaneous domain-driven workflows.

This was the motivation behind my dedicating my (quite) limited free time to investigate remedies
 to what appeared to be an uncalled-for complexity. I singled out those four areas : 
 componentization, visual debugging, testing, concurrency control. I am happy that finally the 
 first step is in a sufficient state of progress that it can be shared. 
 
 **That first step is a componentization model for cyclejs**, that builds upon the original idea 
 of a component as a function and extends it further. Components are (mostly) what they used to 
 be. Components can however now be parameterized through a dedicated argument `settings`, 
 capturing the **component's customization concern**. Components, importantly, can be built through
 a series of **component combinators** which eliminate a lot of stream noisy, repetitive code. Those
  component combinators have been extracted and 
  abstracted from the 20K lines of code, so they should cover a large number of cases that one 
  encounters. The proposed component model could be seen in many ways a generalization of that of 
  `React`, extending it to handle concerns other than the view, which opens the door to using a `JSX`-like syntax if you so fancy. The component model also sets up the work for tracing and visualization tools for the second step, **without any 
  modification of cyclejs internals.** 

This is really a working draft, akin to a proof of concept. Performance was not at all looked upon, 
combinators only work with rxjs, the version of cycle used brings us back to the time 
when cyclejs could still be considered a library (vs. a framework), build is not optimized, etc. 

It works nicely though. It succeeds in providing a **higher-level abstraction** so you can focus on 
the **interdependence** of components that defines the user interface **logic**, rather than having
 to constantly fiddle with a large amount of **implementation details**. 

Each combinator features (and if not, will feature) a dedicated non-trivial example of use, and is 
documented and tested. A sample application is available to showcase how combinators work 
together with components to build a non-trivial application.

**A series of articles covers the theoretical underpinning** in more details (read 
chronologically, they constitute a long read, but I think they are very interesting). A [specific article](http://brucou.github.io/posts/applying-componentization-to-reactive-systems---sample-application/) shows the 
step-by-step building of the show-cased sample application. A shorter introduction can be found in the `README` for the repository. 

Let's now see some examples of use.

## Login gateway
For instance, the structure behind a login section of an application goes as such:

```javascript
export const App = Switch({
  on: convertAuthToIsLoggedIn,
  as : 'switchedOn',
}, [
  Case({ when: IS_NOT_LOGGED_IN }, [
    LoginPage({ redirect: '/component-combinators/examples/SwitchLogin/index.html?_ijt=7a193qn02ufeu5it8ofa231v7e' })
  ]),
  Case({ when: IS_LOGGED_IN }, [
    MainPage
  ]),
]);
```

and translates the simple design :

- Functional specifications
    - if user is logged, show the main page
    - if user is not logged, show the login page, and redirect to `index` route when login is performed
- Technical specifications
    - `MainPage` takes the concern of implementing the main page logic.
    - `LoginPage` is parameterized by a redirect route, and is in charge of logging in the user
    - `convertAuthToIsLoggedIn` emits `IS_NOT_LOGGED_IN` or `IS_LOGGED_IN` according to whether the user is logged or not

The same code could be written in a `JSX`-like dialect as :

```javascript
export const App = 
  <Switch on=convertAuthToIsLoggedIn as='switchedOn'>
      <Case when=IS_NOT_LOGGED_IN>
        <LoginPage redirect='/component-combinators/examples/SwitchLogin/index.html?_ijt=7a193qn02ufeu5it8ofa231v7e'/>
      </Case>
      <Case when=IS_LOGGED_IN>
        <MainPage\/>
      </Case>
  </Switch>
```

The same code could also be written in a dedicated DSL :

```javascript
export const App = `
  Switch On convertAuthToIsLoggedIn (As switchedOn)
    When IS_NOT_LOGGED_IN :
      LoginPage {redirect:'/component-combinators/examples/SwitchLogin/index.html?_ijt=7a193qn02ufeu5it8ofa231v7e'}
    When IS_LOGGED_IN :
      MainPage
`
```

Syntax, whichever one chosen (we will work only with the first one) is but a detail. 
What is important here is that :

- the stream wiring concern has disappeared within the `Switch` combinator (i.e. has been 
abstracted out), while the user interface logic can be written in a way which is very close to its specification, hence easier to 
understand and check for correctness 
- The developer cannot make any mistake in the stream switching logic, nor 
does he have to check while debugging that the error does not come from an erroneous switch 
handling. Provided that the `Switch` combinator has been properly implemented and tested, the 
corresponding concern is out of the way.
- A debugging developer can narrow down a cause of misbehaviour for example by selectively 
modifying arguments, deleting branches of the component tree, stubbing components, etc. That is, reasoning, investigating can be made at a component level first, before, if necessary, going at the lower stream level.

Let's seee another example.

## Nested routing
The following implementation corresponds to :

- Functional specifications
    - user visits '/' -> display home page
        - home page allows to navigate to different sections of the application
    - when the user visit a given section of the application
        - a breadcrumb shows the user where he stands in the sitemap
        - a series of clickable cards is displayed
            - when the user clicks on a given card, details about that card are displayed, and corresponding to a specific route for possible bookmarking
- Technical specifications
    - `HomePage` takes the concern of implementing the home page logic.
    - `Card` is parameterized by its card content, and is in charge of implementing the card logic
    - `CardDetail` is parameterized by its card content, and is in charge of displaying the extra details of the card

```javascript
export const App = InjectSourcesAndSettings({
  sourceFactory: injectRouteSource,
  settings: {
    sinkNames: [DOM_SINK, 'router'],
  }
}, [
  OnRoute({ route: '' }, [
    HomePage
  ]),
  OnRoute({ route: 'aspirational' }, [
    InjectSourcesAndSettings({ settings: { breadcrumbs: ['aspirational'] } }, [
      AspirationalPageHeader, [
        Card(BLACBIRD_CARD_INFO),
        OnRoute({ route: BLACK_BIRD_DETAIL_ROUTE }, [
          CardDetail(BLACBIRD_CARD_INFO)
        ]),
        Card(TECHX_CARD_INFO),
        OnRoute({ route: TECHX_CARD_DETAIL_ROUTE }, [
          CardDetail(TECHX_CARD_INFO)
        ]),
        Card(TYPOGRAPHICS_CARD_INFO),
        OnRoute({
          route: TYPOGRAPHICS_CARD_DETAIL_ROUTE,
        }, [
          CardDetail(TYPOGRAPHICS_CARD_INFO)
        ]),
      ]])
  ]),
]);
```

The (gory) nested routing switching logic is hidden behind the `OnRoute` combinator. With that out
 of the way, the routing logic can be expressed very naturally (in a very similar way to React 
router's [dynamic routing](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy/dynamic-routing), in which the router is a component 
like any other). There is no pre-configuration of routes, outside of the application. Routes are 
directly and naturally included in their context.

Let's attack dynamic lists.

## Dynamically changing list of items

The following implementation corresponds to :

- Functional specifications
    - display a list of cards reflecting input information from a card database
    - a pagination section allows to display X cards at a time
- Technical specifications
    - `Card` is parameterized by its card content, and is in charge of implementing the card logic
    - `Pagination` is in charge of the page number change logic

```javascript
export const App = InjectSources({
  fetchedCardsInfo$: fetchCardsInfo,
  fetchedPageNumber$: fetchPageNumber
}, [
  ForEach({
      from: 'fetchedCardsInfo$',
      as: 'items',
      sinkNames: [DOM_SINK],
    }, [AspirationalPageHeader, [
      ListOf({ list: 'items', as: 'cardInfo' }, [
        EmptyComponent, // Component activated in case list is empty
        Card, // // Component activated otherwise
      ])
    ]]
  ),
  ForEach({
    from: 'fetchedPageNumber$',
    as: 'pageNumber',
    sinkNames: [DOM_SINK, 'domainAction$']
  }, [
    Pagination
  ])
]);
```

The reactive update (on `fetchedCardsInfo$`) and iteration logic (on the array of items received 
from `fetchedCardsInfo$`) are taken care of with the `ForEach` and the `ListOf` combinators.

I hope that by now, even if you do not understand the full syntax and semantics of the component 
combinators, you realize somewhat the merits of using a component model, under which an application
 is written as a component tree, where components are glued with component combinators. I certainly 
think it is simpler to write, and more importantly, simpler to read, maintain and debug.

Let's have a proper look at combinators' syntax and the available combinators extracted from the 
20K-line cyclejs codebase.
 
# Combinators
## Syntax
In general combinators follow a common syntax : 

- `Combinator :: Settings -> ComponentTree -> Component`
    - `Component :: Sources -> Settings -> Sinks`
    - `ComponentTree :: ChildrenComponents | [ParentComponent, ChildrenComponents]`
    - `ParentComponent:: Component`
    - `ChildrenComponents :: Array<Component>`

## Combinator list
The proposed library has the following combinators :

| Combinator      | Description | 
| --------- | :-----|
| [FSM](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/efsm/)      |    Activate components based on inputs, and current state of a state machine. Allows to implement a flow of screens and actions according to complex control flow rules.  |
| [OnRoute](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/router/)      |    Activate a component based on the route changes. Allows nested routing. |
| [Switch](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/switch/)  | Activate component(s) depending on the incoming value of a source| 
| [ForEach](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/foreach/)     |   Activate component for each incoming value of a source| 
| [ListOf](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/listof/)      |    Activate a list of a given component based on an array of items |
| [Pipe](https://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/pipe/)      |    Sequentially compose components |
| [InjectSources](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/injectsources/)      |    Activate a component which will be injected extra sources |
| [InjectSourcesAndSettings](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/injectsourcesandsettings/)      |    Activate a component which will receive extra sources and extra settings |
| [InSlot](https://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/inslot/) | Assign DOM content to a slot|
| [m](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/mm/)      |    The core combinator from which all other combinators are derived. `m` basically traverses a component tree, applying default or provided reducing functions along the way.  |

Documentation, demo and tests for each combinator can be found in its respective repository.

# Roadmaps

<details>
  <summary>Roadmap v0.5</summary>
  <p>Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer
  must have some memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage.
  An input device as well as some form of output device is
  recommended.</p>
</details>

## Roadmap v0.5
The core target of this release will be to prepare the architecture for visual tracing, and 
specify the (visual) shape that this should take. A small proof of concept should be produced. A 
secondary target is to start a very basic UI component library, not going over the proof of 
concept level.

The current roadmap for the v0.5 stands as :

- Core
    - see what can be done to have a better concurrency model (i.e. beyond FSM)
    - [ ] type contracts error handling for component's settings (which types of component 
    combinator expects, types of settings, etc.)
    - [ ] error management : [error boundaries?](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)
    - [ ] logging and visualization (!)
    - [ ] conversion to web components
- Component library
  - [ ] a small one with the basics - should be able to copy a lot from react?
    - so many of them, https://bosonic.github.io/elements/dialogs-modals.html, cf. 
    materializecss, etc.
- Demo
  - [ ] demo from Angular2 book on github site
  - [ ] [Real world app?](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)
- Testing
    - [ ] Model-based testing for FSM, i.e. automatic test cases generation
    - [ ] study testing with pupeeteer.js (chrome headless browser)
- Combinators
    - [ ] [Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) combinator (render DOM in a specific location)
    - [ ] `Catch` combinator? cf. Core -- error management
    - [ ] Switch combinator 
      - [ ] cover the `default:` part of switch statement 
    - [ ] State machine combinator `FSM`
      - [ ] convert FSM structure to graphml or dot or tgf format
      - [ ] automatic generation of graphical representation of the FSM
      - [ ] refactor the asynchronous FSM into synchronous EHFSM + async module
        - this adds the hierarchical part, improvement in core library are automatically translated in improvement to this library, and closed/open principle advantages
      - [ ] investigate prior art
        - https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION
        - http://blog.sproutcore.com/statecharts-in-sproutcore/ 
    - [ ] Event combinator `WithEvents`
    - [ ] State combinator `WithState`
    - [ ] Action combinator `ComputeActions`
- Distribution
  - [ ] monorepo?
  - [ ] individual combinator packages?

## Roadmap v0.4
Please note that library is still wildly under development :

- APIs ~~might~~ will go through breaking changes
- you might encounter problems in production

    - [x] Action driver 
    - [x] sequential composition combinator (`Pipe`)

# Installation
## Running tests
Tests are performed with `QUnit`, i.e. in the browser. This allows debugging code in the browser, and 
also the possbility in a debugging session to actually display some components' output directly in 
the DOM (vs. looking at some virtual representation of the DOM). To run the available tests, in 
the root directory, type : 

- `npm install`
- `npm run build-node-test`
- have a look at `/test/index.js` to pick up which test you want to run
- `npm run test`
- then open with a local webserver the `index.html` in `test` directory
