# The case for a component combinator library ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
This component combinator library comes from some pain points I experimented while dealing with implementing interactive applications, which make heavy use of streams and try to use componentization :

- the stream plumbery between components is hard to read and make sense of
  - this is specially true with deep and large reactive graphs
  - and when you have to process mentally miscellaneous level of `flatMap`
- achieving reusability through parameterization leads to more in-your-face stream gymnastic 
    - using `prop$` to pass properties can become unwieldy when there are a lot of properties involved

The application under development should be expressed as simply or as complex as it is per its design, while keeping the stream complexity at a lower layer. 

Let's see some examples.

## Login gateway
For instance, the structure behind a login section of an application goes as such:

```javascript
export const App = Switch({
  on: convertAuthToIsLoggedIn,
  sinkNames: ['auth$', DOM_SINK, 'router'],
  as : 'switchedOn',
  trace: 'Switch'
}, [
  Case({ when: IS_NOT_LOGGED_IN, trace: 'LoginPage Case' }, [
    LoginPage({ redirect: '/component-combinators/examples/SwitchLogin/index.html?_ijt=7a193qn02ufeu5it8ofa231v7e' })
  ]),
  Case({ when: IS_LOGGED_IN, trace: 'MainPage Case' }, [
    MainPage
  ]),
]);

```

and translates the simple design :

- Functional specifications
    - if user is logged, show the main page
    - if user is not logged, show the login page, and redirect to `index` route when login is performed
- Technical specifications
    - `MainPage` takes the concern of implementing the main page logic.
    - `LoginPage` is parameterized by a redirect route, and is in charge of logging in the user
    - `convertAuthToIsLoggedIn` emits `IS_NOT_LOGGED_IN` or `IS_LOGGED_IN` according to whether the user is logged or not
    
The stream switching logic is hidden behind the `Switch` combinator.

## Nested routing
The following implementation corresponds to :

- Functional specifications
    - user visits '/' -> display home page
        - home page allows to navigate to different sections of the application
    - when the user visit a given section of the application
        - a breadcrumb shows the user where he stands in the sitemap
        - a series of clickable cards is displayed
            - when the user clicks on a given card, details about that card are displayed, and corresponding to a specific route for possible bookmarking
- Technical specifications
    - `HomePage` takes the concern of implementing the home page logic.
    - `Card` is parameterized by its card content, and is in charge of implementing the card logic
    - `CardDetail` is parameterized by its card content, and is in charge of displaying the extra details of the card

```javascript
export const App = InjectSourcesAndSettings({
  sourceFactory: injectRouteSource,
  settings: {
    sinkNames: [DOM_SINK, 'router'],
    routeSource: ROUTE_SOURCE,
    trace: 'App'
  }
}, [
  OnRoute({ route: '', trace: 'OnRoute (/)' }, [
    HomePage
  ]),
  OnRoute({ route: 'aspirational', trace: 'OnRoute  (/aspirational)' }, [
    InjectSourcesAndSettings({ settings: { breadcrumbs: ['aspirational'] } }, [
      AspirationalPageHeader, [
        Card(BLACBIRD_CARD_INFO),
        OnRoute({ route: BLACK_BIRD_DETAIL_ROUTE, trace: `OnRoute (${BLACK_BIRD_DETAIL_ROUTE})` }, [
          CardDetail(BLACBIRD_CARD_INFO)
        ]),
        Card(TECHX_CARD_INFO),
        OnRoute({ route: TECHX_CARD_DETAIL_ROUTE, trace: `OnRoute (${TECHX_CARD_DETAIL_ROUTE})` }, [
          CardDetail(TECHX_CARD_INFO)
        ]),
        Card(TYPOGRAPHICS_CARD_INFO),
        OnRoute({
          route: TYPOGRAPHICS_CARD_DETAIL_ROUTE,
          trace: `OnRoute (${TYPOGRAPHICS_CARD_DETAIL_ROUTE})`
        }, [
          CardDetail(TYPOGRAPHICS_CARD_INFO)
        ]),
      ]])
  ]),
]);
```

The nested routing switching logic is hidden behind the `OnRoute` combinator.

## Dynamically changing list of items

The following implementation corresponds to :

- Functional specifications
    - display a list of cards reflecting input information from a card database
    - a pagination section allows to display X cards at a time
- Technical specifications
    - `Card` is parameterized by its card content, and is in charge of implementing the card logic
    - `Pagination` is in charge of the page number change logic

```javascript
export const App = InjectSources({
  fetchedCardsInfo$: fetchCardsInfo,
  fetchedPageNumber$: fetchPageNumber
}, [
  ForEach({
      from: 'fetchedCardsInfo$',
      as: 'items',
      sinkNames: [DOM_SINK],
      trace: 'ForEach card'
    }, [AspirationalPageHeader, [
      ListOf({ list: 'items', as: 'cardInfo', trace: 'ForEach card > ListOf' }, [
        EmptyComponent,
        Card,
      ])
    ]]
  ),
  ForEach({
    from: 'fetchedPageNumber$',
    as: 'pageNumber',
    sinkNames: [DOM_SINK, 'domainAction$']
  }, [
    Pagination
  ])
]);

```

The iteration logic are taken care of with the `ForEach` and the `ListOf` combinators.

# Combinators
## Syntax
In general combinators follow a common syntax : 

- `Combinator :: Settings -> ComponentTree -> Component`
    - `Component :: Sources -> Settings -> Sinks`
    - `ComponentTree :: ChildrenComponents | [ParentComponent, ChildrenComponents]`
    - `ParentComponent:: Component`
    - `ChildrenComponents :: Array<Component>`

## Combinator list
The proposed library has the following combinators :

| Combinator      | Description | 
| --------- | :-----|
| [FSM](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/efsm/)      |    Activate components based on inputs, and current state of a state machine. Allows to implement a flow of screens and actions according to complex control flow rules.  |
| [OnRoute](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/router/)      |    Activate a component based on the route changes. Allows nested routing. |
| [Switch](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/switch/)  | Activate component(s) depending on the incoming value of a source| 
| [ForEach](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/foreach/)     |   Activate component for each incoming value of a source| 
| [ListOf](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/listof/)      |    Activate a list of a given component based on an array of items |
| [Pipe](https://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/pipe/)      |    Sequentially compose components |
| [InjectSources](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/injectsources/)      |    Activate a component which will be injected extra sources |
| [InjectSourcesAndSettings](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/injectsourcesandsettings/)      |    Activate a component which will receive extra sources and extra settings |
| [InSlot](https://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/inslot/) | Assign DOM content to a slot|
| [m](http://brucou.github.io/projects/component-combinators/mm/)      |    The core combinator from which all other combinators are derived. m basically traverses a component tree, applying reducing functions along the way.  |

Documentation, demo and tests for each combinator can be found in its respective repository.

# Roadmaps

## Roadmap v0.5
The core target of this release will be to prepare the architecture for visual tracing, and 
specify the (visual) shape that this should take. A small proof of concept should be produced. A 
secondary target is to start a very basic UI component library, not going over the proof of 
concept level.

The current roadmap for the v0.5 stands as :

- Core
    - see what can be done to have a better concurrency model (i.e. beyond FSM)
    - [ ] type contracts error handling for component's settings (which types of component 
    combinator expects, types of settings, etc.)
    - [ ] error management : [error boundaries?](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)
    - [ ] logging and visualization (!)
    - [ ] conversion to web components
- Component library
  - [ ] a small one with the basics - should be able to copy a lot from react?
    - so many of them, https://bosonic.github.io/elements/dialogs-modals.html, cf. 
    materializecss, etc.
- Demo
  - [ ] demo from Angular2 book on github site
  - [ ] [Real world app?](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)
- Testing
    - [ ] Model-based testing for FSM, i.e. automatic test cases generation
    - [ ] study testing with pupeeteer.js (chrome headless browser)
- Combinators
    - [ ] [Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) combinator (render DOM in a specific location)
    - [ ] `Catch` combinator? cf. Core -- error management
    - [ ] Switch combinator 
      - [ ] cover the `default:` part of switch statement 
    - [ ] State machine combinator `FSM`
      - [ ] convert FSM structure to graphml or dot or tgf format
      - [ ] automatic generation of graphical representation of the FSM
      - [ ] refactor the asynchronous FSM into synchronous EHFSM + async module
        - this adds the hierarchical part, improvement in core library are automatically translated in improvement to this library, and closed/open principle advantages
      - [ ] investigate prior art
        - https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION
        - http://blog.sproutcore.com/statecharts-in-sproutcore/ 
    - [ ] Event combinator `WithEvents`
    - [ ] State combinator `WithState`
    - [ ] Action combinator `ComputeActions`
- Distribution
  - [ ] monorepo?
  - [ ] individual combinator packages?

## Roadmap v0.4

# Installation
## Running tests
Tests are performed with QUnit, i.e. in the browser. This allows debugging code in the browser, and 
also the possbility in a debugging session to actually display some components' output directly in 
the DOM (vs. looking at some virtual representation of the DOM). To run the available tests, in 
the root directory, type : 

- `npm install`
- `npm run build-node-test`
- have a look at `/test/index.js` to pick up which test you want to run
- `npm run test`
- then open with a local webserver the `index.html` in `test` directory
